          <p>Located in beautiful Portland Oregon's pearl district. This movie 
              theater was built during the late 1700s, so you know it has some 
              history behind it. 
              <br>
              <br>
              The theater can hold up to One million people in one sitting. This 
              number is very impressive but thats not the only thing that is impressive about this theater. 
              <br>
              <br>
              The front desk serves some of the best hot dogs and popcorn on the west coast, besides the movie 
              theaters in California, they probably have the best theater hands down.

              In this Japanese animation, cyborg federal agent Maj. Motoko Kusanagi (Mimi Woods) trails 
              "The Puppet Master" (Abe Lasser), who illegally hacks into the computerized minds of cyborg-human hybrids.
              Her pursuit of a man who can modify the identity of strangers leaves Motoko pondering her own makeup and what life might be like if she had more human traits. 
              With her partner (Richard George), she corners the hacker, 
              but her curiosity about her identity sends the case in an unforeseen direction.
